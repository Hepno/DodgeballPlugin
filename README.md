This plugin was originally made as a trial project for my SpaceDelta Developer application. It adds a dodgeball gamemode where players get a configurable number of snowballs from the config and shoot eachother to get points. There are two teams (red & blue), the teams have their own side of the map and players cannot cross the middle line.

**Placeholders** %teamPointsBlue% %teamPointsRed%

**Permissions:** dodgeball.arena, dodgeball.arena.join, dodgeball.arena.list, dodgeball.arena.leave, dodgeball.arena.teams

**Commands:** /arena <join|leave|list|teams>
